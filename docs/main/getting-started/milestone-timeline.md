# Milestone Timeline

### Stage 1 Milestones (VITSH'25 Round 1)

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### Team Formation&#x20;

We first formed the Team on September 05, 2025. Our team consists of K S Aditiaya, J C Kawin, Dhivyan Jeshua, Sugeeth Jayaraj, T S Shivani,&#x20;
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Preliminary Research and Content Application

We settled on a creating a software platform that integrates multiple services while innovating new ones.

During this time, J C Kawin and Dhivyan Jeshua held extensive discussions on what topic to select.

We finally settled on "Student Innovation" in the medical field.&#x20;
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Research in the field

Originally, the plan was to innovate in the hardware sector by creating an integrated medical drone delivery system that would be consumer facing while also helping out EMTs. We thought that it could be nationalised during times of NATIONAL Emergency.

However, after extensive research in the field, we figured out that the current drone space includes ethical and moral considerations that are currently beyond the scope of the timebound nature of Phase 1.

So we reworked out timelines and revamped the project status. We are now operating under the Software Category and with plans to shift to hardware when needed.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Presentation Generation and MVP pitch

We created our first version of the SIH Presentation and generated our MVP pitch by September 23, 2025.

We held discussions with our mentor and with Sathya sir (Robotics) to create a structure and formulate a plan for the roadmap and future of our plan.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### The Actual Pitch

On September 24, 2025; we pitched our idea to the VITSIH Round 1 Panel, with a consumer facing app\
We were lucky that our idea got accepted and selected.


{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

### Stage 2 Milestones: VITSIH'25 Round 2 and onwards

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### Consumer facing App with SOS enabled

To build and complete a consumer facing app complete with authentication and data storage based off Firebase.

The app should serve as a single point of contact for all services related to the medical field, including ordering medicines etc.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Operator facing Web Console

To build an operator facing web console with a good feature set, with working SOS management systems. They will be able to take over calls, oversee automated proceedings, and intervene and override classify and redirect manually.

The SOS system APIs should be open-ended, ensuring that Device OEMs can tap into the configurations and build those systems into the OS level, enabling and leveraging features like global OS-level gesture based&#x20;
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Doctor Facing Web Console

To build a Doctor Facing Web Console that classifies SOS cases based on preliminary triage levels and also overall overview of all cases that are on his waitlist.&#x20;

In the future, it should be able to expand into a Hospital Integrated Management Suite.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Shopkeeper Console

The job of the integrated pharmacy Web app management system:

1. Expose the current inventory status upon placing an order.
2. Placing manual orders.
3. Live order status tracking with an integrated triage system which prioritizes orders placed via SOS on high priority.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Creation of Forum

A safe place where people can ask doctors questions and get answers to their questions in real life.

This requires immense centralisation of data.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Official Channel

Where doctors can bust myths and provide updates related to the world of medicine, and push out advisories for the latest developments in medical tech.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Lab Technician&#x20;

A portal via which lab technicians get prioritised tasks and the ability to append their comments, notes and observations to existing cases, thus creating a single trust system with proper data transfer that immediately populates the doctor portal.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Triple Delivery System

The aim is to build a delivery system that responds accurately to different levels of triage. \
Extreme emergencies should be able to invoke autonomous drones with auto-flight correction
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### AI based Smarter Classification of Request

The load on the manual operators would be reduced due to the introduction of AI-based smart classification.
{% endstep %}
