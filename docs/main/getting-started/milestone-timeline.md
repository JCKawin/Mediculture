### Preliminary Research and Content Application

We settled on a creating a software platform that integrates multiple services while innovating new ones.

During this time, J C Kawin and Dhivyan Jeshua held extensive discussions on what topic to select.

We finally settled on "Student Innovation" in the medical field.&#x20;

### Research in the field

Originally, the plan was to innovate in the hardware sector by creating an integrated medical drone delivery system that would be consumer facing while also helping out EMTs. We thought that it could be nationalised during times of NATIONAL Emergency.

However, after extensive research in the field, we figured out that the current drone space includes ethical and moral considerations that are currently beyond the scope of the timebound nature of Phase 1.

So we reworked out timelines and revamped the project status. We are now operating under the Software Category and with plans to shift to hardware when needed.
