### Feasibility and Scope

\
This project mainly claims to serve the following members of society:

1. Middle-aged people who mainly prefer convenience over cost due to their busy schedules and tight constraints.
2. Elderly people who are mostly under medication for chronic diseases such as cardiac-related issues, diabetes, cancer, etc.
3. To handle emergencies instantly, which would save lives hassle-free
4. Authorized doctors who are ready to consult patients.

Data can also be extracted and used for trend analysis in the public domain with prior permission. Collected data helps governments and health institutions plan, predict outbreaks, and improve policies.

The project connects institutions, improves convenience, and strengthens cooperation to provide smoother, reliable services; among the public and private sectors.
